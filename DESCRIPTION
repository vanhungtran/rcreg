Title: Random Coefficient Regression Models for Repeated Measurements
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(
    person("Your", "Name", email = "your.email@example.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
    )
Description: Provides a high-level interface for fitting random coefficient
    regression models (random intercept and random slope linear mixed models)
    for repeated measurement data. The package simplifies the specification of
    longitudinal mixed models by wrapping 'lme4', offering convenient functions
    for model fitting, summarization, prediction, and diagnostics. Designed
    specifically for repeated measures with random intercepts, random slopes,
    and their covariance structures.
